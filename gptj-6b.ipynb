The team behind the project is proud to announce their first mainnet release!\n","\n","Playing games together and against each other is becoming increasingly common in our modern lives. To participate in this trend, many mobile games have sprung up that can be accessed either on your phone or on the web. The latest project from the team is ElectrumAI, which is similar in concept to the Ethereum blockchain.\n","\n","Firstly, ElectrumAI is a sports based blockchain platform which allows you to find the game you want and go on a global journey to matchmaking with thousands of other players on your team, either in person or virtually.\n","\n","Our first game is called Elite Eggs, which is a sports inspired FIFA style game where you play football against friends, teams or a new opponent.\n","\n","ELITE EGGS GAME\n","\n","In the game, there are many different game modes that you can play. You can join a cup with up to four other players, a season with up to 20, or a league with up to 30, and play the match of your choice.\n","\n","CUP\n","\n","You can start off by joining a local cup tournament. Each cup is made up of local teams and is hosted by various companies or schools. This is where you make a local team to play against each other and compete against the other teams. For cups hosted by local companies or schools, the leagues are usually limited to a single company or school, with a few exceptions.\n","\n","Cup winners are crowned based on the criteria set in the rules for the cup. Some cups also allow for unique features, such as inviting players from other cups, in order to create a bracket system.\n","\n","For cups hosted by schools, the cups are hosted in rotation, with the team hosting the cup hosting the next cup when it’s time to rotate. Cup tournaments are also allocated a unique cup ID.\n","\n","LEAGUE\n","\n","If you would like to play more than one game, you can join a league instead. A league is designed to have a single winner. In order to join a league, you need to be a member of a single school or company. If you are playing a cup, you are free to join a league as soon as you win.
